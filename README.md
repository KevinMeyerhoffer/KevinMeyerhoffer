### Hi there ğŸ‘‹, I'm Kevin
#### Developer in training at the o'clock school


Started coding in the middle of the summer 2021, and started loving it.
After several months of self-taught learning, decision is made:

I want to make it **my job**, and decided to make the journey to o'clock



- ğŸŒ±  Currently learning HTML / CSS / JS / REACT 

- ğŸš‰  Fun fact: I've been a train driver
