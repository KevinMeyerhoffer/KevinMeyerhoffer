### Hi there ğŸ‘‹, I'm Kevin
#### I am developer in training at the o'clock school


I started coding in the middle of the summer 2021, and started loving it.
After several months of self-taught learning, decision is made, I want to make it my job, and decided to make the journey to o'clock



- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML / CSS / JS / REACT 

- ğŸš‰ Fun fact: I've been a train driver
