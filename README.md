### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Kevin
#### I am developer in training at the o'clock school
I started coding in the middle of the summer 21, and started loving it.
after several months of self-taught learning, the decision is made, I want to make it my job, and I decided to make the journey to o'clock
